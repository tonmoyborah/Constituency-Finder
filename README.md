# Constituency-Finder
Find out the constituency of a given location

This is an additional feature to the [maps](https://github.com/datameet/maps) repository created by **Datameet**. All thanks to them.
I have added a `contituency-finder.py` file to it which can be used to find the constituency of any given location in (longitude, latitude) format.
