# Constituency-Finder
Find out the constituency of a given location

This is an additional feature to the [maps](https://github.com/datameet/maps) repository created by **Datameet**. All thanks to them.
I have added a `contituency-finder.py` file to it which can be used to find the constituency of any given location in (longitude, latitude) format. 
To use it, open the `constituency_finder.py` file and change the value of the `test_point` to the location you want to check the constituency for in the `(longitude, latitude)` format. Note that google maps gives it in the reversed way i.e. `(latitude, longitude)` so you have to reverse it.
